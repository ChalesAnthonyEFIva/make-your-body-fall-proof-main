                    <p>In the first week, I went through the program 2 times. I felt nervous and unsure of myself, but was able to easily follow the program. My muscles felt different - but not in a bad way. It felt good to be moving and I felt optimistic that I was making a difference.</p>
                    <p>In the second week, I did the program 3 times. I felt more confident and it took me less time to complete the routine. I was starting to feel stronger. Now that the program was more familiar, I looked forward to doing the program each day.</p>

                   <p>Unfortunately, most exercise programs for body stabilization and injury prevention are designed by people who are <u>unqualified</u>. And truthfully, just being a physiotherapist or personal trainer, does NOT mean someone is qualified. In my research I discovered that there are countless programs being promoted by so-called ‘experts’ whose greatest qualification was their time spent in the gym.</p>
                   <p>Sure – this might be OK for someone who is simply looking to get fit or lose a few pounds. It might also work for someone who is looking to build strength or tone their muscles.
                </p>
                   <p>BUT – that wasn’t what I needed. <strong>I NEEDED BETTER</strong>.</p>
                   <p>I needed a proven program with <u>real science</u> behind it, that was designed by a trusted resource with years of experience. And this is why I decided to try <u>10 Yoga Poses to Make Your Body Fall-Proof</u> .</p>

                   <p>Even worse, some exercise therapy and injury recovery classes required that I attend in person, working directly with their trainers ($$$) in a city nowhere near where I lived… and I was unable to drive at the time!

                   <p>This was a very big deal in my world. I wasn’t in a financial position to purchase expensive clothing and equipment. I certainly was unable to commit to costly membership dues at a different gym or yoga studio. And I absolutely was not willing to travel for hours to work directly with a so-called expert.</p><br>

                   <p>This was definitely something I appreciated. You might ask how a program can be both easy and challenging. How can a program help you get started, but also be something you want to do in the future? I needed a program that I could start once I felt able… But I also needed a program that would challenge me along the way… and I’m sure that you do too!</p>

                   <p><strong>10 Yoga Poses to Make Your Body Fall-Proof</strong> is the ONLY way to protect yourself and those you love. This is the only way to truly bulletproof your body.</p>
                   <p>I spent the time breaking down the research I did on this program to make me feel confident that this was the ONLY program I needed to safeguard my body and protect myself. Hopefully you can benefit from my hours spent on this ‘homework’.</p>
                   <p><strong>Remember – the reason I had so much time to devote to research was because I was laid up with my injuries from a simple FALL! I was unable to go out with friends, do simple tasks at home, or DRIVE! I had way too much time on my hands. I was bored, anxious, and worried this could happen again. </strong></p>
